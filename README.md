# üß† System Identification of a Second-Order Filter Using Neural Networks

This project models the behavior of a classical second-order dynamic system (spring-mass-damper or low-pass filter) using a supervised learning approach. A synthetic dataset is generated from the second-order differential equation, and a feedforward neural network is trained to predict the system output.

## üìå Objective

To train an artificial neural network (ANN) to learn the dynamics of a second-order system given a history of system inputs and outputs. The model is intended to approximate a physical system's response ‚Äî similar to control systems or signal filtering applications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Details

### System Equation:

\[
\ddot{y}(t) + 2Œ∂œâ_n \dot{y}(t) + œâ_n^2 y(t) = œâ_n^2 u(t)
\]

This represents a second-order system where:
- `y(t)` is the output (e.g., displacement or signal)
- `u(t)` is the input (e.g., force or control signal)
- `œâ‚Çô` is the natural frequency
- `Œ∂` is the damping ratio

### Numerical Method:
- Solved using **Euler integration** with `dt = 0.01 s`
- Generated `5000` data samples with random inputs `u(t)`

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Feature Vector** | `[y(t-1), y(t-2), u(t-1), u(t-2)]` |
| **Target** | `y(t)` |
| **Normalization** | Inputs and outputs scaled using `MinMaxScaler` |
| **Model Architecture** | Feedforward ANN with 2 hidden layers (20 neurons each), `tanh` activation |
| **Loss Function** | Mean Squared Error (MSE) |
| **Optimizer** | Adam (`lr = 0.001`) |
| **Training** | 80/20 train-test split, trained for 100 epochs |

## üìà Results

The trained model accurately tracks the system‚Äôs response on unseen data. The predicted output closely matches the true simulated output from the second-order system.
